Dojo Desert Island Disks
========================

This repo and deck were produced for a talk at the [web-5 conference, 2012](http://web-5.org/). 

The slide content is edited and served out of a slides.json file via a node-powered server. 
There's a simple editor for slide edits and getting the spacial arrangement of slides that impress.js supports. That's is nasty code, it worked as well and for as long as it needed to, that's all.
